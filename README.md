### What to do? ###

* Name M4L objects, so that they can be easily automated in Live
* Process incoming CC, to control basic behavior


### Storing presets: ideas ###

* Have the device 'read' a midi clip... 
* Save numbered presets within the Set 
* Have it read from a .txt within the device folder?
* Have it read from the clip's number?
